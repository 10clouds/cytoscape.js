Plans for future versions of Cytoscape.js can be found on [the issue tracker](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/milestones).



 * **Compound node layouts** : We are in the process of porting layouts tailored to compound graphs to Cytoscape.js.  In the meanwhile, you can still use compound nodes with other layouts like `preset`.

 * **New and improved layouts** : Cytoscape.js supports some basic layouts currently, and we will add layouts and improve the existing ones to provide more options to developers and users.

 * **Graph importers** : Cytoscape.js supports graph data in JSON format.  We will not be adding support for other formats in Cytoscape.js itself, but we will be working to create a separate library that could be used on the client side or the server side (via Node.js) to convert formats like GraphML and XGMML to JSON.
